# Presentation
This [presentation](presentation.pdf) is part of an assignment in my data analysis class (SIS 750) at the School of International Service at American University. The assignment was to present data on a topic of choice with two analyses. The first analysis shows and describes data on a key variable and the second analysis shows and describes data on a second variable, including a sub-group comparison.

This presentation pulls from [data](recent-grads.csv) published by the American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series & FiveThirtyEight and describes the relationship between the share of women in majors and the median earnings of recent graduates (less than 28 years old) who are full-time, year-roud workers, by major.

Also included in this repository is the [script](presentation.R) used in the initial analysis and the [R Markdown](presentation.Rmd) file used to create the presentation using a Beamer template.
